            If you checked-in from Australia all the way through to Phuket (via
            Bangkok or Singapore)
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you are arriving directly from Australia, you will transit only
            in Bangkok/Singapore. (Travelers who transferred in Bangkok and
            completed the immigration process there will arrive at the Phuket
            domestic terminal - but
            <strong> your bags will arrive at </strong> the International
            Terminal. Follow the signs on arrival to collect your bags at
            International â€“ the two terminals are linked by a walkway. Guests
            travelling via Singapore will clear immigration and collect their
            bags directly at the International terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the baggage claim our luggage porters with MCR signs will assist
            you, then you should exit the terminal by EXIT 2 on the right-hand
            side, where you will see our representatives holding the Choices MCR
            logo to direct you to the transports. Transfers take approximately
            75 minutes to the hotel.
