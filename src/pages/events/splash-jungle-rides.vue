          <p>Riders are dispatched into enclosed high speed AquaTubes that spiral alongside each other through multiple lanes of twists and turns into a 360-degree loop before a surprise drop of colourful lanes.</p>

          <p>With loads of over-the-edge wall time, speeds up to 33km/h (20.5mph), surprise drops, and twisting turns, this family experience ensures everyone is smiling at the end. Our rafts allow children to sit side-by-side with their parents ensuring they feel secure around every corner.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align: center">Super Bowl</h2>
          <p>Make your way to the top of Slide Tower and get prepared to take a sensational spin. You’ll have to grab your tube tightly as you let go and plunge down a dark tube rush into the giant super bowl. You’ll make several wild turns before ending in an exhilarating transition into a splashdown pool.</p>

          <p>Go into a dark tube followed by a rush high up a vertical wall. Get ready then for the reverse free fall which accelerates you over a 15 meter high transition bump. It’s not over until you drop down through a splashdown pool.</p>

          <p>A fun and educational (oh no!) area letting families and children play, spray and wash the frowns away, with a series of water elements demonstrating the movement and effects of water. Great for developing minds, or for anyone that just wants to relax and have fun spraying water at one another.</p>
