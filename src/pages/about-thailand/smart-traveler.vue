        <h1>Smart
          Traveller
          Advice</h1>
        <p><strong>The following information is a summary
            of the Smart Traveller Advice produced by
            the Australian Governments Department
            of Foreign Affairs and Trade (as of
            January 2023)</strong></p>
        <p>We advise you to exercise normal safety
          precautions in Thailand. You should
          exercise common sense and look out for
          suspicious behaviour, as you would in
          Australia and New Zealand. Monitor the
          media and other sources for changes to
          local travelling conditions.</p>
        <p>Thailand regulates the import of
          prescription and non-prescription
          medication. Some medications require
          a letter from the prescribing doctor.
          Contact the Thailand High Commission
          before you travel to check the rules
          regarding any medicines you take. Keep
          your medication in its original packaging.</p>
        <p>Border areas near Cambodia, Myanmar
          and Malaysia are dangerous due to
          violence, armed conflict and landmines.
          Pay close attention to your personal
          security. Don’t travel to the 4 most
          southern provinces of the Thailand-Malaysia border: Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat
          and Songkhla. These areas experience
          frequent violence and bombings.
          Penalties for drug offences are severe
          and include the mandatory death
          sentence for drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>Commercial surrogacy is illegal.
          E-cigarettes, e-baraku, vaporisers and
          refills are illegal. Smoking on some
          beaches is illegal. Travel without carrying
          identification is illegal. Thailand is a
          multicultural but predominantly a
          Buddhist country. There are conservative
          standards of dress and behaviours in
          many areas of Thailand.</p>

        <h1>Thailand
          Do’s &
          Don’ts</h1>
        <h2>Thailand Do’s</h2>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Do respect Thai culture.</li>
          <li>Do dress respectfully when visiting temples
            and palaces. Knees and shoulders should
            be covered.</li>
          <li>Do respect all Buddha images. Buddha
            images are sacred in Thailand and are not
            to be climbed or sat on.</li>
          <li>Do stand up when you hear the national
            anthem or royal anthem.</li>
          <li>Do take off your shoes before entering
            temples and people’s homes.</li>
          <li>Do return a wai (a traditional Thai greeting).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Thailand Don’ts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t point to anything with your feet and
            don’t place your feet on the table while
            sitting. If you accidentally drop some
            money, don’t step on it. This would be
            insulting the King whose image is on Thai
            currency.</li>
          <li>Don’t raise your voice. In Thai culture,
            keeping calm and not raising your voice are
            qualities that are admired. Shouting and
            getting angry won’t do you any favors.</li>
          <li>Don’t touch monks. Women should never
            touch a monk or hand anything directly to
            them.</li>
          <li>Don’t show disrespect to the Thai royal
            family. Thailand has strict laws on this
            which also cover social media.</li>
          <li>Don’t take Buddha images out of the
            country. Stores and market vendors will
            probably still sell them to you without
            telling you about the regulations.</li>
          <li>Don’t touch a Thai person’s head. The head
            is regarded as the most sacred part of the
            body and shouldn’t be touched.</li>
        </ul>
