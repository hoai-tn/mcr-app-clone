        <p>Sukko spa treatments are based on ancient Thai

          hour course before becoming part of the Sukko team.</p>
        <p><strong>Aroma Body Massage</strong></p>
        <p>This all-time popular type of massage is performed
          with a healing touch accompanied by especially
          blended aromatic oils. This is a holistic remedy. As
          the massage is performed to benefit the vascular,
          lymphatic, muscular and nervous systems of the body,
          emotional health and well-being are also restored.</p>

        <p><strong>Traditional Siam Body Massage</strong></p>
        <p>Siam massage has a spiritual base, using theories of
          energy flow and balance. Pressure is applied to key
          points along the body’s energy channels to stimulate
          proper energy flow. This helps to balance the senses
          and works deeply to restore the body to normal
          function for improved health.</p>
