              You need to rest your mind and body, so what better way to unwind
              than to indulge in hotel’s all-inclusive package? Enjoy lunch,
              dinner, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and snacks across the
              resort.

                In our opinion, Yes. Like all packages, it is what you make of
                it. Review the details below, especially the drinks list to see
                whether it suits your style. The hotel is generally quite
                expensive for drinks and snacks outside the functioned events
                put on by . Having recently experienced a day there in November,
                a basic lunch, an A la carte dinner and two beers and some
                coffees, cost approximately $180AUD for the day.

              Anything ordered outside the drinks package attached will be
              charged at hotel charges. As for the A la carte dining options
              most restaurants within the resort only have one or two items on
              the menu that require a surcharge. Everything else is included,
              providing great value.

                The only way they can offer this package is if it is done on a
                PER ROOM BASIS. Basically, that means that if there is TWO
                people per room allocation, both people must take the package.
