                  <h2>THE PEOPLE & LANGUAGE</h2>
                  <p> Over 95 percent of Thailand’s
                    population is Buddhist, with Muslim,
                    Christian, Hindu and animist
                    minorities. The national language is
                    Thai, though English is widely spoken
                    in Bangkok and most major tourist
                    centres.</p>
                  <p>The King and Thai monarchy are
                    widely revered and respected in
                    Thailand and Lese Majeste laws are
                    in force. It is a criminal offence to
                    defame or criticize the monarchy in
                    any way either in conversation or in
                    writing. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>VISAS</h2>
                  <p>Most nationalities qualify for a
                    30-day visa on arrival. Those who
                    do not qualify can usually obtain a
                    15-day visa on arrival (Two photos
                    needed) Some exceptions do however
                    apply, please contact your closest
                    Thai embassy or consulate for more
                    information on visa requirements.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>CUSTOMS</h2>
                  <p>Duty free allowance for visitors is
                    200 cigarettes and one litre of wine
                    or spirits. Importing weapons and
                    pornography is prohibited. Penalties
                    for attempting to smuggle drugs are
                    very severe in Thailand, including life
                    imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>Any amount of traveller’s cheques
                    or drafts may be imported, but cash
                    in excess of USD 10,000 must be
                    declared. Not more than THB 50,000
                    in cash may be exported. Antiques
                    and Buddha images require export
                    licenses.</p>

                  <h2>ARRIVAL FORMALITIES</h2>
                  <p>Passengers who will transit in
                    Bangkok before an onward domestic
                    flight must clear immigration on
                    arrival in Bangkok before proceeding
                    to the transit gate for the onward
                    flight. In most cases your luggage will
                    be through-checked from the point of
                    origin to the final destination. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>CLOTHING</h2>
                  <p>Comfortable lightweight clothing
                    in natural fabrics such as cotton is
                    suitable for traveling in Thailand. It
                    is advisable to cover arms and legs
                    in the evenings and remember to
                    use repellent against biting insects
                    at most times. A lightweight raincoat
                    and umbrella are a good idea for any
                    occasional showers and an umbrella
                    can also offer useful shade from
                    the sun.</p>
                  <p>Visitors should not wear shorts, short
                    skirts or other revealing clothing
                    and shoulders should be covered
                    when visiting temples, monasteries
                    or venues related to the monarchy.
                    Shoes must be removed before
                    entering religious buildings or a
                    private home. It is therefore useful to
                    wear shoes without too many laces
                    and which can easily be taken off.</p>

                  <h2>HEALTH</h2>
                  <p>Certificates of inoculation for
                    cholera or yellow fever are required
                    if you arrive from an infected area.
                    Some border areas of Thailand are
                    malarial, and visitors should take the
                    necessary precautions. Please check
                    with your local health practitioner for
                    the latest advice.</p>

                    B5, B2, B1, 50 satang and 25 satang

                    can be readily exchanged with banks
                    and moneychangers. Major credit
                    cards are widely accepted in hotels,
                    restaurants, and shops. Give a 10%
                    tip at restaurants if a service charge
                    is not included. Tip porters and bag
                    boys B20. There’s no need to tip taxi
                    drivers.</p>

                  <p>Electric current is usually 220 volts
                    A/C (50 cycles). Various plugs and
                    sockets are used. Most hotels supply
                    adapters and transformers for 110V
                    equipment.</p>

                  <h2>SHOPPING</h2>
                  <p>Thailand offers some good shopping
                    and many day and nights bazaars.
                    Only buy jewellery at reputable
                    shops and insist on a certificate
                    guaranteeing the quality. Avoid street
                    touts.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>FOOD</h2>
                  <p>Food is usually prepared and served
                    with the ubiquitous fish sauce called
                    nam pla. Typical Thai dishes are
                    served either with rice or noodles and
                    a meal usually constitutes a variety
                    of dishes (Meat, vegetables, fish or
                    eggs) served family style for sharing.
                    Due to the strong Buddhist influence
                    in Thailand, vegetarian food is widely
                    available. If you are allergic to fish
                    or fish derivatives, seafood or nuts
                    please be sure to advise the venue as
                    these ingredients are widely used in
                    many Thai dishes.</p>

                  <h2>WATER</h2>
                  <p>It is not advisable to drink tap water
                    but bottled mineral water is safe
                    and available everywhere. All hotels
                    provide a complimentary bottle of
                    local mineral water per person in
                    the room. Ice cubes in drinks are
                    usually made from purified water
                    and are usually not a problem. Some
                    minor stomach problems are always
                    possible when travelling in exotic
                    countries. Bring a supply of your
                    usual anti-diarrhea medicine.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>SAFETY</h2>
                  <p>On the whole Thailand is a safe
                    country to visit and its people are
                    renowned for their warm friendliness
                    and hospitality. As a global rule,
                    however, never leave your belongings
                    unattended and always maintain eye
                    contact or a firm grip on cameras and
                    shoulder bags. Taxis are relatively
                    cheap and easily accessed. Ask the
                    hotel or restaurant to call one for
                    you or simply hail a cab in the street.
                    Always ask to turn on the meter (In
                    Thai language this sounds like ‘Bert
                    meter kab’</p>

                  <h2>INTERNET</h2>
                  <p>Broadband Wi-Fi internet is
                    commonplace in Thailand and
                    speeds are very good. Most hotels,
                    restaurants and coffee shops offer
                    complimentary access these days. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h2>TELEPHONE</h2>
                  <p>If you have worldwide coverage, you
                    can bring your own mobile phone
                    and use it to make domestic or
                    international calls. Check with your
                    mobile phone provider for the costs
                    before using it abroad - it may be
                    expensive.</p>
                  <p>Most hotels now have IDD phones in
                    rooms. It may not always be possible
                    to make international calls in remote
                    areas.</p>

                  <h2>Tuk-Tuks</h2>
                  <p>For short distances tuk tuks are
                    fine, but their small size makes
                    them uncomfortable for anything
                    longer than about 30 minutes. In the
                    main resorts like Patong, even short
                    distances cost around 200 Baht. You
                    should state your destination and
                    agree on the price before setting
                    off! Trips further afield, beyond the
                    immediate beach
                    area can cost anything up to 400 Baht
                    - depending on the distance and your
                    bargaining skills!</p>

                    in most areas – The hotel concierge
                    will be able to call one for you. Fares
                    are set at 50 Baht for the first two
                    kilometres and 7 Baht per additional
                    kilometre, though for longer distances
                    flat rates may be charged. Airconditioned car taxis can be hired at
                    all the main resort areas with rates
                    similar to the tuk tuks. Expect to
                    bargain your fare in advance.</p>

                  <p>These local open-air buses (painted
                    bright blue for easy recognition)
                    run regularly between 7.00am and
                    6.00pm and have the destination
                    written in English on the outside of
                    the bus. There are no designated
                    bus stops, which means you can
                    stop them anywhere on the route. In
                    Patong, your best spot for catching a
                    bus, is along the beach road outside
                    the tourist police box. Standard cost
                    for trips to/from Patong to locations
                    such as Phuket Town, Surin and
                    Kamala is around 40 Baht per person.</p>
