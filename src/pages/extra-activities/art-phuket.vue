        <h1>It’s about
          Art
          Phuket</h1>
        <p>You will be picked up at 08:00. Today, we take you deeper
          into the art scene in Phuket (because there is defi nitely
          more than the copy and paste art you fi nd in the tourist
          areas like Patong). The day starts with a drive towards
          the coast to visit Phuket town’s small streets with local
          artists at their galleries & homes and feel free to ask the
          artists themselves about their paintings (translation by
          our guide). Stroll around streets with antique shops and
          art galleries and have a look at what’s “art” in Phuket.
          Finally, continue to visit local artists (paintings, batik
          and sculptures – contemporary and classical) and have
          a chance to follow a short workshop and create a small
          piece of your own art.</p>
