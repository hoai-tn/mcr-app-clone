                  <p>Goods purchased in Thailand are VAT
                    inclusive. However, foreign visitors (with a
                    few exceptions) have the benefit to receive
                    a 7% VAT refund on luxury goods purchased
                    from shops that participate in the ‘VAT Refund
                    for Tourists’ scheme. When you see a ‘VAT
                    Refund for Tourists’ sign, you can receive a
                    7% refund of the VAT levied on goods at the
                    shop. However, certain conditions apply, and
                    you won’t be able to claim your refund until
                    you depart Thailand from an international
                    airport.</p>
