        <h1>About
          Thailand</h1>
        <p>Called the “Land of Smiles,”
          Thailand has become one of the
          leading travel destinations in Asia
          over the last few decades. Officially
          known as the Kingdom of Thailand,
          this Southeast Asian nation is the
          only country in the region to have
          avoided colonialism, remaining a
          sovereign country in its own right.
          Economically, Thailand is still
          developing, although this doesn’t
          stop it from dominating much of the
          region’s rice and tourism industries.</p>
        <p>Home to nearly 11 million people, the
          Thailand’s capital, Bangkok is a vast
          network of busy streets, commercial
          centres and modern delights that hug
          the meandering banks of the Chao
          Phraya River. The perfect balance of
          city, country, mountains and water,
          Thailand is a dream for both nature
          lovers and urban dwellers with cheap
          massages on every corner.</p>
