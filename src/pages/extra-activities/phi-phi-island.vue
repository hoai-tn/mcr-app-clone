        <h1>Phi Phi
          Island by
          Speedboat</h1>
        <p>You will be picked up at 08:00. Escape to a quieter, more natural side of southern Thailand with this
          day trip from Phuket. Travel by speedboat across the
          Andaman Sea to the six scenic Phi Phi Islands. The
          journey to Phi Phi takes around 45 minutes, passing by
          spectacular limestone karsts that jut out from the blue
          seas. Sit back and relax, enjoying the views as the boat
          cruises closer to paradise. Pass by Maya Bay, arguably one of Thailand’s most beautiful places, just for
          sightseeing. The bay is so stunning, in fact, that it was
          used as the setting for the famous Hollywood movie
          ‘The Beach’.</p>
        <p>Continue around the islands, Phi Phi Lay Cove, and
          Monkey Beach. Each of these stretches of island boasts
          swaying palm trees and white sands. There are also
          calm, clear waters brimming with fi sh for those who
          wish to discover Thailand’s underwater beauty.
          During the day, lunch will be served at Tonsai Bay. This
          southern stretch of Phi Phi Ley island offers sweeping
          views of the surrounding sea. The afternoon is spent
          cruising to Bamboo Islands and possibly other islands
          nearby, for more chances to snorkel and swim in the
          Andaman Sea.</p>
        <p>After a spectacular day cruising the Phi Phi Islands,
          it is time to return to Phuket. Transfer back by boat and
          car, arriving at the hotel in the early evening. <strong>(L)</strong></p>
