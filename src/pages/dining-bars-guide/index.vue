                  <p>For high end dining (and prices!) look no
                    further than the Ta Khai restaurant located
                    within the ultra-luxury Rosewood resort, just
                    opposite to the Marriott Merlin Beach.
                    Featuring weathered pavilions made from re-purposed materials, the atmosphere is rustic
                    Thai village and an ideal gathering place for
                    dining by the ocean with friends and family.
                    Authentic, simple and traditional dishes are
                    based on daily availability of the freshest
                    seafood, with the menu planned around the
                    local fishermen’s daily catch and Southern
                    Thai recipes. </p>

                  </h2>
                  <p>Bangla Road really comes to life once the sun
                    sets. The road is closed to vehicle traffic and
                    becomes a 400 metre festival of neon lights,
                    loud music and cheap beer. Jammed most
                    nights of the year, it is quite a friendly and
                    lively place to walk around as bars and clubs
                    compete with each other for customers.
                    Ideal if you’re looking for a fun night out in
                    Phuket.</p>
                  <p>It sometimes seems like anything goes along
                    Bangla Road, with the incredible variety of
                    things to see and do. Alongside international - standard nightclubs are hundreds of beer
                    bars as well as street performances, vendors,
                    lounge bars, games, live music and more.
                    Taken with the right attitude, it is a barrel
                    of laughs. </p>

                      in shot form, such as the Hannibal (a mix
                      of various schnapps and liqueurs) and the
                      Nebula Jellyfish (a mix of vodka, rum and
                      various liqueurs). But don’t go to crazy.
