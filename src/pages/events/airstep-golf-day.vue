          <p>
            An ongoing tradition at the MCR is the Airstep Golf Day and in 2023
            we’ll be playing Red Mountain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The award-winning Red Mountain Golf Club nestles its way through a
            truly dramatic former tin mine site in the heart of Phuket. Red
            Mountain is one of Asia’s most decorated courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course has been cleverly routed to take advantage of a huge
            variety of landforms and dizzying elevation changes. Scars left from
            the tin mine era have been imaginatively incorporated into the
            overall scheme, creating unique characteristics and establishing an
            indelible link with an important era in the Island’s past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst the course is undoubtedly challenging, numerous risk and
            reward options create a fun playing environment, an exhilarating
            test of golf and a breathtaking scenic tour around a course destined
            to become a golfi ng landmark in the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per usual, the Ambrose format will kick off early in the day with
            a buffet lunch, awards and drinks to conclude.
