        <h1>Shopping
          Shuttle</h1>
        <p>Enjoy all that Phuket has to offer on
          the retail front, visiting major shopping
          centres at Central Festival, Jungceylon
          and Central Phuket.</p>
        <p>Central plays host to over 120 outlets
          selling products ranging from silk to
          sushi, from Levi’s to laptops, from
          books to barbecues - if it isn’t on sale
          at Central you probably didn’t need it
          anyway! It’s literally possible to spend
          a full day here - shopping, catching
          the latest movies, and dining out at the
          range of international restaurants that
          offer everything from French cuisine to
          Japanese to local Thai outlets.</p>
        <p>At Jungceylon the 200-plus stores in
          this shopping heaven sell brand-name
          clothes, specs, sunglasses, cosmetics
          and perfumes, shoes, DVDs, computer
          games, tons of mobile phones and
          accessories, electrical goods but it is
          also a great entertainment haven with
          a five-room SF Cinema and a 16-lane
          bowling alley, perfect for rainy days or
          to escape the heat of the day.</p>
