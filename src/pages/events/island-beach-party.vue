          <p>
            Get ready for a fun day out! If it’s activity you want then you get
            to choose between a range of water activities such as jet skis,
            banana boats, and kayaks or perhaps you may be keen to have a go at
            volleyball or Thai foot volleyball with the local crew. The other
            option is just to relax on the beach, get a massage and take in the
            surrounds of the island. Enjoy a buffet lunch which includes a mix
            of appetizers, seafood, meat, salads and desserts.
